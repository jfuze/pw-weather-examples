# pw-weather-examples
A few short tests and simple playwright framework exercising weather.com's search functionality

## Setup and running

Make sure to run `npm install` after pulling down the project to set up playwright and its browsers locally. Afterwards you can run `npm run test` which will fire off the 4 tests on 3 browsers (12 total tests), or you can run `npm run test:chrome` if you want to quickly execute the 4 tests.

Both included scripts will run the tests headlessly and then open playwright's built in reporting page.
